# Tech

This directory is the destination of the RTL generated by the
HLS-based and Chisel-based accelerator design flows in the
`accelerators` folder. It is the communication point between the ESP
accelerator design flows and the SoC design flow, which can _see_ the
library of available accelerators in the `tech` folder.

This folder is organized by technology target (FPGA or ASIC):
* Xilinx Virtex 7 (`virtex7`)
* Virtex Ultrascale (`virtexu`)
* Ultrascale+ (`virtexup`)

The HLS-generated RTL for the accelerators gets installed in the
`tech` folder corresponding to the selected technology target for the
HLS. The `acc` subfolder is for the accelerator RTL. The `memgen`
subfolder is for the accelerator local memory generated with the
*PLMGen* tool (`tools/plmgen`) for the SystemC accelerators. The
`sccs` subfolder is for any non-accelerator component generated with
HLS, like the SystemC implementation of the caches.
