# Contributing to ESP

Looking to contribute to ESP? The ESP team welcomes external contributions and collaborations! Here's how you can help.

## ESP documentation

The best way to get started with ESP is the fastly growing set of guides and video tutorials on the [ESP website](https://esp.cs.columbia.edu/docs).

You can stay up to date with ESP's new features by:

- subscribing to our [mailing list](https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/esp)

- following the [Columbia System-Level Design group](https://twitter.com/columbiasld) on Twitter

- subscribing to our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYpZYCJJNGm5m-kV8aaTZSQ?view_as=subscriber) and turning on the notifications

## Issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/sld-columbia/esp/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests and pull requests.

- Please keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

- Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Use the contact email esp-info(at)lists.cs.columbia.edu instead.

- Please try to use the proper label when opening an issue. We reserve the right to change or add labels as appropriate.

## Bug reports

Good bug reports are extremely helpful!

- Whenever appropriate, we suggest the use of the [issue templates](https://github.com/sld-columbia/esp/issues/new/choose) for bug reports and feature requests.

- Use the GitHub issue search to check if the issue has already been reported.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. We are a small research team, but we will do our best to address them if we see fit. Please provide as much detail and context as possible to make your case about the merits of the feature.

## Pull requests

Good [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are really helpful! We suggest you contact us before embarking in significant work toward a pull request, if we coordinate early the merge process will be more timely and successful.

Here are some guidelines for contributing:

- Never push to `master`. Instead, create a new branch starting from `master` for your work and use that branch to develop and test your feature or bugfix.

- To merge your work to ESP create a Pull Request to discuss your work with the repository owner.

- The quality of the Git commits description is important. Write descriptive git commit messages. Here is an [article](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) with detailed guidelines.

- Before opening a Pull Request rebase your branch to create meaningful commits, squashing multiple commits that jointly implement a feature or bugfix and removing commits that are not relevant.

- The Pull Request review may take a few iterations and we may ask you to make changes to your commits.

- ESP is a fairly complex repository. Try to get a good undestanding of ESP's structure so that your work will fit right in and you will be able to use any existing feature that you might need.
